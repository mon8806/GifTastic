# GifTastic

When you click on a dog type, 10 gif of that dog will be display from a giphy api. When you touch on a gif it should stop and animate again.  On the search button called woof, input a dog breed. A new button with that dog breed will show up next the last button and do the same function as the rest of the buttons.

This project is useful because it utilizes api, instead of randoming searching for different gifs, we get all the data from the giphy api.

To start the project, the user can either search a dog breed or click on a dog breed button to display the gif.

The project is made with javascript,jquery and api data.
